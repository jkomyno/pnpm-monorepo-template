# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## How to add a changeset

1. Run `pnpm changeset` at the repo root.
2. Select the packages you want to include.
3. Choose the version type (patch, minor, major).
4. Write a short summary (this goes in the changelog).
5. Commit the generated file in `.changeset/`.

## Release flow

- Pushing to `main` with new changesets triggers the **Release** workflow.
- It opens or updates a "Version Packages" PR with version bumps and changelog.
- Merging that PR runs the release (build + publish to npm) using [npm trusted publishing (OIDC)](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers)—no `NPM_TOKEN` needed. Configure the trusted publisher on npmjs.com per package (see the root README, "Publishing (OIDC)").
